Hello Class of 2021, hope you are doing good

Wonderful questions asked and wonderful answers given

Thanks Akash for that introduction. yeah I'm a huge cricket fan, if you want to discuss about T20 world cup squad selections, just ping me okay

yeah myself sudheer and I work for analytics and reporting team in GTI

to talk about learning opportunities yeah, it can be boring to learn sometimes, I do procrastinate a lot but trust me this is the best time to learn

first let me ask this what are the learning opportunities you have already used in JP?- anyone can unmute and speak

I can see you people already did some research and pursuing some of those opportunities

JP believes in continuous learning and thats why there are a lot of learning portals out there which you might know like pluralsight, learning portal, tech primers, tech labs etc 
but there are some other opportunities that are talked less but very useful opportunities

Firstly, Cloudcamedy where you can do cloud certifications and the best part is, you don't req manager approval this. 
With the cloud, individuals and small businesses can snap their fingers and instantly set up enterprise-class services - then think of how much cloud is used in JP 
so this is a best place to learn cloud

one is TAP - which is tuition assistance program - want to learn from a course outside JP or do some sort of certifications, JP will sponsor/fund
some amount for that. All you need to do this talk to your managers. This looks easy but you can only avail it after completion of one year at chase.

Guess what I got my last approval last week and I'm very exited to utilize it

Other good platform is O'Rielly - where you can find books from diff publishers and videos on lot of topics - this is a community more than a platform
Somtimes I find udemy courses in O'Rielly and its free for us in JP - so it helped me a lot

other than these there will be lob specific or lunch learn sessions do paripate and network and learn

I suggest and I'm sure most of you will use these opportunities because your skill matters to our company.

yeah that's from my side, thanks for listening to me if you are..
